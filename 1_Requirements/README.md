**Requirements**

**Need to have basic knowledge about the mathematical equations of the all components**

1)Impedance Z = R or XLor XC(if only one is present)

2)Impedance in series only Z = √(R2 + X2) (if both R and one type of X are present)

3)Impedance in series only Z = √(R2 + (|XL - XC|)2) (if R, XL, and XC are all present)

4)Impedance in any circuit = R + jX (j is the imaginary number √(-1))

5)Resistance R = ΔV / I

6)Inductive reactance XL = 2πƒL = ωL

7)Capacative reactance XC = 1 / 2πƒC = 1 / ωC
